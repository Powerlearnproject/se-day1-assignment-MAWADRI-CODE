#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is all about writing codes or instructions for computers with the aim of designing or building applications or games or applications that make life easier thus solving real world problems by providing technology based solutions through coding.
The importance of software engineering are;
1. I can create anything to provide solutions problems in different aspects of life, in healthcare, education, industralization thus improving standardof lives through fast, accurate and cost friendly innovative coding.
2. Software engineering fosters faster economic growth by creating easy to use applications for business to enhance production, marketing, accounting and delivery of products and services to consumers.
3. Software engineering provides secure systems thus protecting information of businesses  against cyber threats.
4. Software engineering also bridges communication gap in businesses and other stakeholders, knowledge shared and experiences arrived at through effective communication software development provides indeed enhances colaboration and growth.
5. Using software to promote eco-friendly practices contributes to resource optimization and environmental sustainability.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Mastering the machine (1956-1967)
This era marked the begining of software enginering, where developers focused on optimizing hardware resources. the first compilers and operating systems were developed and the initial low-level computer aided software engineering (CASE) tools emerged

2. Mastering the proceess (1968-1982)
In response to software crisis, this era saw the birth of software engineering as a discipline. developers aimed to reduce risks,improve quality,and increase productivity. Software development methodologies like SREM and SADT emerged, emphasizing modulaziation and information hiding.

3. Mastering complexity(1983-1992)
This era introduced personal computers,expanding software applications. graphical user interfaces and visual programming brought software closer to customers. Object-oriented (OO) methods like OMT and UML gained popularity, enabling efficient reuse of software and inproving productivity.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning; this defines project scope, goals and deliverables. identification of stakeholders, resources and timelines.
2. Analysis; this gathers and documents software requirements through feasibility studies,user interviews and market research.
3. Design; This provides creation of architectural designs, user interface prototypes, and detailed specifications for the software.
4. Implementation; writing and testing the scope, integrating components, and building the software.
5. Testing; This verifies software functionality, performance and security through various test techniques.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

To manage and structure projects appropriately, waterfall and agile methodologies are suitable to manage and structure projects based on it's nature and requirements.
1. When a project is dynamic or complex in nature, it is suitable to use agile methodology because it allows continuous improvement based on issues arising from its usage thus requiring further developments forexample food processing app may need more updates depending on user needs.While simple projects in nature may developed by waterfall methodology because of it's well defined requirements and processes with minimal changes to it or not even desirable forexample medical software that requires compliance from a governing body.
2. Interms of risk management, waterfall is high risk since issues may be identified late which not be the case with agile methodology where issues are identified immediately and corrected. High risk areas waterfall methodology mitigates are in manufacturing and hardware development forexample cars, air planes with high cost operations while low risk areas agile methodology mitigates are in e-commerce platforms forexample spotify.
3. Waterfall methodology follows fixed sequences in it's phase of development that is to say; requirement to design, design to development, development to testing and testing to deployment. while agile follows a circle where development, testing and feedback happens simulteously. Fixed sequence happens in development of large scale systems with strict requirements such as that of medical software systems. simultenous phase of software development happens mostly in web appliacations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated development environments (IDEs) which provides comprehensive development environment for writing, debuging, and testing software codes is important for the following reasons;
1. Provides code completion and suggestions and thus reduce development time and improves code quality.
2. It offers in-built debuging and testing tools which enable develops identify and fix errors quickly.
3. it also provides project management features such as project navigation,file management and build automation.
4. it also facilitates collaraboration among developers by providing code features such as code sharing, version control and real time feedback.

Examples of IDEs are; eclipse, Visual studio and INTELLIJ IDEA.

Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process helps to manage changes in codebases over time is important for the following reasons;
1. VCS helps developers track and manage changes in their codebases over time thus providing history for rollbacks and comparisons in providing computer instructions.
2. Supports collaborations among developers by prorviding features such such branching and merging.
3. it provides back up for codebase so as to mitigate risk of loss.
4. To reduce errors and enhance quality of code, VCS provides changes in the codebase.

Exmaples of code VCS include; GIT, subversion and mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Errors and bugs are faced by software engineer, The solution to this is having automated testings, continous integration and continous deployment.
2. Maintaining and updating legacy codebases. this can be solved by use of automated tools and techniques such as code analysis and migration, and documenting legacy codes.
3. Keeping up to date with emerging technologies, frameworks and tools. This can be mitigated by belonging to technology community,forums and social tech medias where ideas are shared and collaboration in fixing bugs or errors associated with new technologies.
4. Task prioritization is yet another common challenge faced software engineer. This can be solved by employing urgent Vs important matrix by Eisenhower.
5. Burn out challenges affects software engineers. This can be solved by establishing a sustainable work balance, selfcare, taking breaks and taking alot of coffee.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing; invloves testing individual units of code, such as functions and methods to ensure they work well as expected.
Importance; unit testing is important in catching bugs early, it enhances code quality and debuging time. for exaample tesing login function to ensure it correctly validates user credentials.

2. Integration Testing; This is testing how different different units of code work together to ensure seamless integration.
Importance; it helps identify issues with how different components interact thus reducing risk of system failure such as testing how the login function integrates with the database to retrieve user data.

3. System testing; This involes testing the entire software system to ensure it meets requirements and works as expected.
Importance; Helps to ensure system is stable,scalable and secure. Forexample testing e-commerce website can handle multiple users,process payments and manage inventory.

4. Acceptance testing; Involves testing the software system to ensure it meets the requirements and expectattion of end-sers.
Importance; It helps ensure the software system is fit for the purpose and meets the needs of users. Forexample testing a mobile app to ensure it meets the requirements and expectation of the target audience.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prmpt engineering is simple giving instructions to AI by wrting a prompt- a set of commands or questions that is easily understood, with specific details, and with curiousity. 

Importance; Prompt engineering is important interacting with AI model because;
1. Giving an Ai model a clear instruction makes it  easy for the model to understand and thus provide specific results as per the clear instruction.
2. Prompt engineering provides details to the Ai model thus makes the Ai model perform well and better.
3. Prompt engineering experiments with different instructions to see and pick out the the best result that suits user needs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vargue prompt; Tell me something about Power Learn Project

Improved prompt; Tell me how power learn project is reaching millions of young people in African countries. 
The improved is effective because;
1. it's specific and focused on a particular aspect of Power Learn project.
2. Clearly states the demographic and geographic region of interest.
3. There's details to it that increases the likelihood of receiving a relevant and detailed response.
